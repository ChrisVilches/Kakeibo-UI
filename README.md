# Kakeibo (UI)

A simple money management app made in Flutter.

It's basically the same process I used to do in Excel, but turned into a mobile app.

## System dependencies

Linux:

* libsecret-1-dev
* libjsoncpp-dev

For Linux, however, it doesn't work if Flutter was installed using Snap. It only works with manual installation.

Try these commands to install:

```
sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev
sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev
```
